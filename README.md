# meta_overview_sea_ice_available_data

A meta repository that gives an overview of datasets about sea ice (in particular drift and waves in the marginal ice zone) available openly on the internet. The motivation for this repository is that, though quite a few observations of sea ice dynamics, drift, properties, and waves in ice, are available openly, these are at present spread across the internet and may be hard to fine.

The aim of this repository is to be a collaborative, community-driven, central hub for indexing such datasets and related resources.

The main focus of this repository is to index datasets about sea ice drift, waves in ice, and related parameters, in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ).

To contribute, please open an issue referencing some data and / or open a pull request. Please provide i) a short description ii) permanent links to the data indexed. The repository does not host data itself - that would be too much storage requirements. If you need help hosting some data, please open an issue - we will be happy to help.
