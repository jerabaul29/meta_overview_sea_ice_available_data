# meta_overview_sea_ice_available_data

A meta repository that gives an overview of datasets about sea ice (in particular drift and waves in the marginal ice zone) available openly on the internet. The motivation for this repository is that, though quite a few observations of sea ice dynamics, drift, properties, and waves in ice, are available openly, these are at present spread across the internet and may be hard to fine.

The aim of this repository is to be a collaborative, community-driven, central hub for indexing such datasets and related resources.

The main focus of this repository is to index datasets about sea ice drift, waves in ice, and related parameters, in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ).

We use a "more or less chronological" order for the index.

To contribute, please open an issue referencing some data and / or open a pull request. Please provide i) a short description ii) permanent links to the data indexed. The repository does not host data itself - that would be too much storage requirements. If you need help hosting some data, please open an issue - we will be happy to help.

For now we will just keep it as a text file; if the need arises, we can always format it at a later point into a more classical database or similar.

Feel free to share this as broadly as possible - the more people know about this index, the more it will be used and receive new pointers to relevant data and grow. To help disseminating the word about this index, you may want to refer to it in your papers; if you have contributed pointers to data and want to be added to the "authors" list, let me know and I will add you:

## Data index

### Waves in-ice observations made during the SIPEX II voyage of the Aurora Australis, 2012

Eight custom wave sensors were deployed in the Antarctic marginal ice zone along a transect line perpendicular to the ice edge and spread over approximately 200 km, measuring drift and wave information.

## Future work

- Keep growing the index
- If the need emerges, provide a better alternative - some form of searchable database. However, this would be quite a bit of complexity, and a plain text github markdown file seems simplest at this point.

## Contributors

Many thanks to the contributors to this index, first of all scientists who collected the data and made it available, but also the people reporting data to be added to the index! Main maintainer: Jean Rabault; Contributors: Jim Thomson, Daniel M. Watkins.
